# NMFGOT-py
NMFGOT: A Multi-view Learning Framework for the Microbiome and Metabolome Integrative Analysis with Optimal Transport Planã€‚

This is the Python implementation of the JSNMF algorithm. Note that this implementation can employ GPU to speed up the code. 

## 1. Installation
You can use the following command to install JSNMF:
```
pip install JSNMF-py
```

## 2. Usage
The default number of maximum epochs to run, i.e. the `max_epochs` parameter, is set as 200. So it is quite simple to initialize a NMFGOT model with the following code:
```
from JSNMF.model import JSNMF
test_model = JSNMF(rna,atac)
```
After initializing, run the model is also quite easy: 
```
test_model.run()
```
The result is saved in `test_model.result`, which is a dict, and the major output of JSNMF, the complete graph S, can be get with easy access:
```
S = test_model.result['S']
```
`JSNMF` class also has other methods, you can use the `help` or `?` command for more details explanations of the methods.
